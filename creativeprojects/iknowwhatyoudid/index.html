<h2 align="center">by the Admin</h2>
<p align="center"><em>&quot;I know what you did.&quot;</em><br />
  Oh yeah? What's that?<br />
  Did I kill someone with a baseball bat?<br />
  Did I eat ice cream until I got fat?<br />
  Did I use glossy paper instead of matte,<br />
  For an essay which I didn't hand back?<br />
No? Huh, well how about that!</p>
<p align="center"><em>&quot;I know what you did.&quot;</em><br />
  Oh yeah? How so?<br />
  Did I upset someone with a word like &quot;no&quot;?<br />
  Did I hurt someone with a ball of snow?<br />
  Did I make up the answers I didn't know,<br />
  Then act like it was all for show?<br />
No? Huh, well whaddaya know?</p>
<p align="center"><em>&quot;I know what you did.&quot;</em><br />
  Oh yeah? Do tell.<br />
  Did I rig explosives to the door bell?<br />
  Did I make your life a living hell?<br />
  Did I fill your shoes with an acid gel,<br />
  Then forget to ring the old death knell?<br />
No? Huh, I thought that would go well.</p>
<p align="center"><em>&quot;I know what you did.&quot;</em><br />
  Yes, so do I.<br />
  I rigged my phone to daily sigh,<br />
  Those words that are so very sly,<br />
  And it'll go on to the day I die,<br />
  I'm telling you, I cannot lie.<br />
  No? Huh, I've no reply,<br />
To your disbelief. Good day! Good bye!</p>
