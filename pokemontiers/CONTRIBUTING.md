## Portraits

If you don't see the portrait of a character or want to improve the quality of an existing image:
* Image should be of a character's head, centred
* Images should be smaller than 100x100, 64x64 is preferred
* Fork the branch and add images to the appropriate folders, following the existing numbering scheme
* Submit a pull request and I'll review / approve / merge it
